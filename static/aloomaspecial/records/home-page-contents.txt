Our Cleaning Process: What We Do After Every Rental<h2>
Our promise of hygiene isn't just a claim; it's a process. Every unit returned to our yard undergoes a rigorous, multi-point rejuvenation protocol before it's certified ready for the next rental.<list>
Complete Evacuation: The holding tank is fully pumped and flushed.^^
High-Pressure Power Wash: The interior and exterior are blasted with a high-pressure, hot-water stream to remove all residue.^^
Disinfectant Scrub: We manually scrub every interior surface—walls, floor, seat, and urinal—with a powerful, eco-friendly disinfectant.^^
Final Rinse & Dry: The unit is given a final freshwater rinse and allowed to air dry completely.^^
Restocking and Inspection: We restock with premium, 2-ply toilet paper and a new supply of hand sanitizer. A supervisor then performs a final quality inspection, signing off on the unit's readiness.

How We Handle Porta Potty Odors—Even in the Summer<h2>
Odor control is a science, and we have it perfected. Here’s how we ensure our units stay fresh:<list>
The Blue Liquid: It's more than just a dye. Our proprietary deodorizing liquid is a powerful biocidal agent that kills odor-causing bacteria on contact. It doesn't just mask odors; it eliminates them at the source.^^
Proper Ventilation: Every unit is designed with a vent stack that continuously circulates air, pulling odors up and out of the unit.^^
Non-Porous Surfaces: Our modern units are made from non-porous plastics that don't absorb odors like older models can.^^
Strategic Servicing: For long-term rentals or multi-day events, we create a custom service schedule to ensure the units are pumped and recharged well before they can become overwhelmed.
